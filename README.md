# odin-recipes

This is the first project of "The Odin Project". The goal is to make a basic html website containing a homepage and links to a few recipe pages.

This will hopefully showcase the knowledge I've gained so far, mostly creating a solid html boilerplate and using html tags to create clear content and working links.
