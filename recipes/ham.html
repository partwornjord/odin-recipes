                <li>1 sprig thyme</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 rosemary spring</li>
                <li>1 onion, halved</li>
                <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
                <li>1 tbsp black peppercorns</li>
                <li>1 tsp cloves</li>
                <li>2 tbsp English mustard</li>
                <li>70g clear honey</li>
                <li>2 tbsp soft dark brown sugar</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place gammon in a deep saucepan, leaving tied. Tie the rosemary, bay leaves, thyme together and add along with the onion, carrts, peppercorns and cloves.</li>
                    <li>Cover with cold water and bring to the boil, cover with a lid and simmer fo 1 hr 15 mins, checking occasionally to remove scum from the surface.</li>
                    <li>Remove joint from the liquid and leave to cool. Once cool enough to handle remove the thick skin, leaving the thick layer of fat. Score the fat in a criss-cross pattern.</li>
                    <li>Pre-heat the oven to 200C (180C fan). Place the ham in a roasting tray lined with foil. Mix the honey, mustard and sugar and brush generously over the ham.</li>
                    <li>Place in the oven for 15 minutes, remove and brush with more of the mixture, returning for 30 minutes. Remove and leave to cool before carving.</li>
